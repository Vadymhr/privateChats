ChatRooms Fabric Contract (all chats are generated from here)

### What could be changed for Customer Use Case

Logic of chatroom enter / approve etc, logic of creation new chatrooms (could be linked to some othe objects, for example - selling items)

IPFS storage could be changed on some cloud storage - anyway its encrypted)

And design/frontend could be changed any way you need - its simplified with "no complex" libraries for easy usage, but could be React or any)
